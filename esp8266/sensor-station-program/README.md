# ESP8266 -> Sensor Unit Program
This program recieves the analog data from the sensors wired up to the ESP8266. Data includes the Temperature, Humidity, Barometric Pressure, and Light intensity of the environment the ESP8266 is located in. This data is then sent to the backend API, via an HTTP request to the server, to be stored in a database.
